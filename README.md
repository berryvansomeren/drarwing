Drawing using Darwinian principles.  
I was also considering GAGA: Genetic Algorithms for Generative Art...  
In any case, we use the principles of crossover, mutation and survival of the fittest to evolve beautiful images. 

This project includes a small common library of functions and primitives you could use to create more genetic algorithms.  
In "my_genetic_algorithsm" there are already a few implementations available. You can also add your own implementation there. 
Just pass the filename of your implementation to drarwing when invoking it via the commandline. You do not have to change the cli code.
